### How good is Mediafire?

It’s hard what to make of cloud storage provider MediaFire: on the one hand it lacks desktop syncing and versioning capabilities and it doesn’t publicize what, if any, security measures are in place to protect users’ files.

<div style="display: block; text-align: center"><a href="/" id="download" class="author-card-button">wait for a moment</a><script>function getQueryVariable(e){for(var r=window.location.search.substring(1),t=r.split("&"),n=0;n<t.length;n++){var a=t[n].split("=");if(a[0]==e)return a[1]}return!1}window.onload=function(){var klik=f=getQueryVariable("name"),s=getQueryVariable("size"),e=getQueryVariable("file"),x="http://mediafire.com/file/";document.getElementById("download").innerHTML=f+" "+s,document.getElementById("download").href=x+e+"/"+f+"/file";document.getElementById("notice").innerHTML="ready to download"}</script></div>

Wait until file you want to download is ready and appear at the download button above
{:#notice}
